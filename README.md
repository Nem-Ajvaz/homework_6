## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to build a simple weather forecast app for viewing a daily and 5-day forecast.

The acceptance criteria is listed below:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs <br />
WHEN I search for a city <br />
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history <br />
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city <br />
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index<br />
WHEN I view the UV index <br />
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe <br />
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city <br />
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity <br />
WHEN I click on a city in the search history <br />
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city <br />

## Issues faced

I faced a lot of issues with the css for this application, hence why it isn't as cleanly written as i would have liked but rather clumsily put together to meet the objective.
Given some more time i would have liked to clean everything up.
